      <description>Two easy steps
Thank you to everyone that has already activated their DAI on Give Together. Today we made needed changes to the contract. There was a bug that did not forward rDAI to the charities when sent to the contract. This has been fixed in this commit. In addition to the fix, a few new methods have been added, including one to transfer ownership of the contact is necessary.</description>

      <description>No Loss Charitable Donations powered by rDAI
Give Together
Give Together allows you to donate to a new charity each week all at no loss to you!
Each week an Ethereum Smart Contract determines a new charity currently from this list (although we are open to adding more!). This weekâ€™s charity is Code for America and later today the interest generated will be redeemed to them (the contract became live on the mainnet last week).</description>
