No Loss Charitable Donations powered by rDAI

[Give Together](https://givetogether.app/)

[Give Together](https://givetogether.app/) allows you to donate to a new
charity each week all at no loss to you!

Each week an Ethereum Smart Contract determines a new charity currently
from this
[list](https://github.com/Give-Together/give-together/blob/master/Charities.md)
(although we are open to adding more!). This week’s charity is [Code for
America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) and later today the interest
generated will be redeemed to them (the contract became live on the
mainnet last week). The interest accrues from the [Compound
Protocol](https://compound.finance/) and is redeemed to the smart
contract using [rDai](http://rdai.money/). The contract then forwards
the funds to the charity of the week!

### How does this work? {#d642 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="d642"}

[DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/) is a stable coin pegged to USD and
serves as the main method for donating on [Give
Together](https://givetogether.app/). Activating your DAI on Give
Together is as easy as paying the gas fee on the [activate
page](https://givetogether.app/activate). Once your
[DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/) is activated it will be exchanged for
[rDAI](http://rdai.money/) a token that is always redeemable to DAI at
1:1. rDAI enables you to earn interest on your DAI and set a beneficiary
of the interest. This is helpful for easily donating to causes or
charities that you support. You can see a list of causes activate on
rDAI [here](https://app.rdai.money/).

After your activated [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/) is exchanged for
[rDAI](http://rdai.money/) the beneficiary of your interest is set to
the Give Together [smart
contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x931621613f1f1953adb085c2b06d664363e54aaf).
When any funds are sent or redeemed to this contract they are
immediately relayed to the charity of the week. At the end of each week
Give Together will redeem all of the interest accrued by its
contributors. In addition to activating your
[DAI](http://kerdao.com/en/) on [Give
Together](https://givetogether.app/) you can also simply send a ERC-20
token to the contract to have it sent to the charity of the week!
